      - title: Can I get a customized price plan?
        content: >
          Yes! We recognize that your business needs are unique, so we're always
          open to creating a pricing plan that works for you. We can combine
          project rates for content like recurring blog posts with hourly rates
          for website rewrites or editing. 
      - title: Are your prices negotiable?
        content: >
          Sure. We tailor content to each unique need. Some projects are simply
          more complex than others. We'll work with you to find the price point
          that makes sense for your content complexity and cadence. 
      - title: How does the writer placement work?
        content: >
          Many growing businesses are ready for in-house, dedicated writing, but
          don't know where to find reliable hires. We've utilized our years of
          freelance, agency, and in-house content experience to create a
          rigorous training program that prepares writers to provide value right
          away. We recruit sharp individuals, train them, then match them with
          small businesses to find the perfect fit. 
      - title: Can you create stuff that isn't listed here?
        content: >
          Probably! Our team features creatives of all types, and we're always
          excited to make a customer's idea come to life. Let's talk about what
          you have in mind.
