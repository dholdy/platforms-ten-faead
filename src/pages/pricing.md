      - title: Can I get a customized price plan?
        content: >
          Yes! We recognize that your business needs are unique, so we're always
          open to creating a pricing plan that works for you. We can combine
          project rates for content like recurring blog posts with hourly rates
          for website rewrites or editing. 
      - title: Are your prices negotiable?
        content: >
          Sure. We tailor content to each unique need. Some projects are simply
          more complex than others. We'll work with you to find the price point
          that makes sense for your content complexity and cadence.
